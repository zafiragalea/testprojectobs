# What is this app?

This application contains a list of user accounts that must be added. This application can be used by application managers as a database application for the list of users of an application.
You can view the list of accounts according to the most recently added accounts and can specify how many rows in the table to view the list of accounts you want to see.

1. The features available here are quite simple, you can create a new account by clicking the ‘Add New User’ button. When you press it, you will be displayed with a modal popup to fill in the data to create this account.
2. You must complete the data, if there are any errors in filling you will be reminded through the alert provided.
3. Next, you can edit the user data of your choice starting from the name, username, password, and others by pressing the ‘Edit’ button on the line.
4. On certain rows (specific accounts), you can delete them by pressing the ‘Delete’ button.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
